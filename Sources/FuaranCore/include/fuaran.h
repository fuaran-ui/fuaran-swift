 * the buffer with fuaran_dealloc(ptr, len). The buffer is exact-length: there is
 * NO trailing NUL — always honour `len`, never strlen().
 *
 * The pair's REPRESENTATION is pointer-width dependent, because a full pointer
 * only shares a 64-bit word with a length losslessly when pointers are 32-bit:
 *
 *   - Native targets (64-bit — this header's audience): the pair is this
 *     two-word struct, returned by value.
 *   - wasm32 (32-bit pointers): the same pair is a packed uint64_t — `ptr` in
 *     the high 32 bits, `len` in the low 32 — so the JS loader stays byte-for-
 *     byte unchanged. Native code never sees the packed form; it is documented
 *     here only so the two ABIs are on the record together.

 *       has not fed yet. Render the LOADING surface, NOT an empty table.
 *       Flattening this case to zero rows shows "no data" for "not yet".
 *
 *   {"error":{"class":"lookup","code":"NO_ROW_SOURCE","message":"..."}}
 *       No node with that id, or a kind with no row source. A caller mistake —

 * OWNERSHIP CONTRACT (summary)
 *
 *   - INPUT buffers  (fuaran_alloc):  caller-owned. Rust borrows for one call;
 *                                     caller frees with fuaran_dealloc after.
 *   - OUTPUT buffers (inside FuaranBuf): Rust-owned. Caller reads `len` bytes,
 *                                     then frees with fuaran_dealloc(ptr, len).
 *   - SESSION handle (fuaran_session_new): caller-owned; free ONCE with
 *                                     fuaran_session_free.
 *   Every buffer is freed exactly once through fuaran_dealloc; a session exactly
 *   once through fuaran_session_free. Output buffers carry NO trailing NUL.
 *
 * THREADING CONTRACT
 *
 *   A FuaranSession is SINGLE-OWNER: confine it (and all calls that take it) to
 *   ONE thread / executor for its whole lifetime. No Send/Sync guarantee crosses
 *   this boundary — a Swift `actor` wrapper or a Kotlin single-threaded
 *   dispatcher is the intended confinement. fuaran_last_error() reads a
 *   PER-THREAD slot, so read it on the same thread that made the failing
 *   fuaran_session_new call. (On the single-threaded wasm32 host the per-thread
 *   slot degenerates to a single global.)
 *
 * v0 NATIVE SURFACE (Phase 537 decision)
 *
 *   v0 is exactly the session surface declared above. The adopted native-surface
 *   architecture keeps the Rust core as the owner of truth and mutation while a
 *   native tier holds a render-only projection, so ALL native rendering is driven
 *   through a session (session_apply_op -> read back session_tree_json, or
 *   session_project_resolved for a decode-only surface — Phase 650, an additive
 *   projection of the same tree). No stateless entry points are needed for the
 *   native binding tiers.
 *
 *   RESERVED (not in v0; names held for a future stateless surface if demand
 *   appears — do not bind yet):
 *       FuaranBuf fuaran_validate(const uint8_t *ptr, size_t len);
 *       FuaranBuf fuaran_encode_canonical(const uint8_t *ptr, size_t len);
 *       FuaranBuf fuaran_apply(const uint8_t *tree_ptr, size_t tree_len,
 *                              const uint8_t *op_ptr, size_t op_len);
